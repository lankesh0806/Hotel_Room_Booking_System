# Hotel_Room_Booking_System
Description 
Developed a console-based Hotel Room Booking System in Java that allows users to book, cancel, and view hotel room reservations. The application supports different room types (e.g., Deluxe, Standard, Suite), pricing, customer details (name, contact number), and booking IDs. Admin or user can also search bookings by customer name or phone number. Canceled bookings are excluded from active booking records. This project demonstrates practical use of OOP, collections, and modular programming to simulate real-world hotel operations.

Key Features:
•	Book new rooms with customer details and room selection
•	View all current bookings
•	Search booking by name or phone number
•	Cancel existing bookings
•	Room types with different pricing
•	Unique booking ID generation

Technologies Used:
•	Language: Java
•	Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Class-based Structure, Encapsulation
•	Tools & Libraries: Java SE, Scanner, ArrayList, HashMap (optional), File I/O (optional)
•	Functional Concepts: Menu-driven interface, Input validation, Data persistence (optional)
